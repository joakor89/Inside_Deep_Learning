These comprehensive resources serve as invaluable companions, offering detailed insights and guidance essential for honing proficiency in PyTorch and advancing adeptly within the domain of data science.


# Virtual Environment
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
source env/bin/deactivate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Github Environment

Performed from Terminal Console
```sh
1. git init
2. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"]
3. git remote -v
4. git add -A
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "insert here your commit"
7. git status
8. git push origin master
```

### Additional GitHub Commands
if you already created your repository, then:
```sh
1. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"] 
2. same procedure applied above
3. Note: if you already got your ReadMe.md & License.md then,
firstly request your git pull origin master. THIS IS ALWAYS A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE.
4. git push origin master
```
